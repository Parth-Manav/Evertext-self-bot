db.json
db.json.backup
# preventing db.json from being ignored if it was previously tracked, but usually local db should be ignored. 
# However, user mentioned db.json.backup specifically earlier. 
# I will ignore the backup. The main db.json might be needed if it has the initial structure.
# But generally for a bot template, we don't push the DB.
# Let's stick to what was explicitly requested before: db.json.backup.

bin/
# We created a bin/ folder for the rust exe, that probably shouldn't be in the repo if it contains binaries.
# But wait, if the user wants to distribute it... usually binaries aren't committed.
# But for "self-bot" maybe they want it? 
# Best practice: Ignore binaries.
